            Love sports? Into music or food? Set your preferences, and Pop&Go will notify you about events matching your interests. It's like having your own event concierge!

            <h3>3. Travel-Ready Feeds 🌍:</h3>
            Heading to a new city? Pop&Go adapts! If you're in Rome, for instance, expect feeds showcasing events, restaurants, and activities just like the ones you enjoy back home.
