## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders

    Pop & Go is an event discovery platform designed to seamlessly integrate with users' lives, delivering real-time event notifications through SMS, email, and Google Calendar.

The Explore Page empowers users to navigate curated events within 24 hours, encouraging spontaneous engagement. The Itinerary feature adds convenience, allowing users to set date ranges, specify locations, and receive forecasts.
